            View your team mates and rate their playing attributes such as passing 
            and shooting out of 10, they will do the same for you.  Use this data to
            get a gauge for the areas of your game you need to improve and focus 
            accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            After each match, rate each players performance and	check your own form.
            Team generation will take into account both form and attributes helping 
            keep the teams well balanced.
